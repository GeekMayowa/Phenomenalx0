                <h2>Welcome to My PortfolioüôÇ</h2>
                <p id="me">I am Owolabi Faithful, a student at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, specializing in Information and Communication Engineering. With less than a year of professional experience in product management, I have already made a stride in the field, particularly through my participation in the prestigious HNG 11 internship program.</p>
                <p id="me">During this internship; HNG 11; I have honed my skills in practical teamwork and collaboration. I had the opportunity to work with various product management teams and cross-functional groups, including video marketers, product designers, data analysts, and developers. My role often involved removing blockers, writing and reviewing tickets,issues and documentations and ensuring smooth workflows, which greatly contributed to the success of our projects so far.</p>
